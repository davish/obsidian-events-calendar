# Add remote calendar from CalDAV or iCloud

Add any calendar that supports CalDAV over HTTPS basic authentication. This has currently been verified to work for [iCloud Calendars](https://www.icloud.com/calendar). You'll first need to create an [app-specific password](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204397) for this plugin. Armed with that info, you can now add your private Apple Calendars. Note that currently this does not work for Google Calendars as that requires OAuth which is not yet supported.
